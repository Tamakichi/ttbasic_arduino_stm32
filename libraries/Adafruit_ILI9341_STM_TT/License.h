  These displays use SPI to communicate, 4 or 5 pins are required to
  interface (RST is optional)

This is the core graphics library for all our displays, providing a common
set of graphics primitives (points, lines, circles, etc.).  It needs to be
paired with a hardware-specific library for each display device we carry
(to handle the lower-level functions).

Roughly based on Adafruit example sketch: "parsing"
Utilizes the (modified) Adafruit_GPS library https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GPS-Library
20131204: GPS TimeDate with Temperature
  Heavily mucked by M. Ray Burnette to simply use (most) any dumb serial TTL GPS for time-date
  Tested with unit#28146 Parallax module @4800 BAUD http://www.abra-electronics.com/products/28146-Parallax-GPS-Receiver-Module.html
  Tested with uBlox and external antenna @9600 BAUD http://www.ebay.com/itm/390647042336
